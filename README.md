## üñ•Ô∏èInstructions on how to host locally<a name="host"></a>

First, clone the repository.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com/AidanG1/snackRice.git
$ cd snackRice
```
Then set up your virtual environment and install the requirements.
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Next apply database migrations
```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```
Finally, run the website on localhost. Visit localhost:8000 in your browser!
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```
To receive notification messages, create environment variables account_sid, auth_token, and msg_service_sid with your Twilio credentials and GOOGLE_KEY with your Google Maps API key.
Then open up the flask server.
```bash
$ python notification.py
```
After that, use ngrok to open port 5050 to the internet. 
```bash
$ ngrok.exe http 5050
```
Copy the url from ngrok into the Twilio GUI and you are now set up to receive notifications!
